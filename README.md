# Image-Recognition-Using-Raspberry-Pi
Number Plate Recognition System. With the easy accessibility of single board computers and the rise of ease of use of Image Recognition APIs, we are now able to create highly complex systems using low computational devices. In this project, I will be creating a number plate recognition system using a Raspberry Pi and various sensors.
