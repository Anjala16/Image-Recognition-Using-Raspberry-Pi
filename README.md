# Image-Recognition-Using-Raspberry-Pi
Number Plate Recognition System. With the easy accessibility of single board computers and the rise of ease of use of Image Recognition APIs, we are now able to create highly complex systems using low computational devices. In this project, I will be creating a number plate recognition system using a Raspberry Pi and various sensors.

In this project, I will be creating a number plate recognition system using a Raspberry Pi and various sensors.

This project will be a simple display of how we can conduct image recognition using a small board computer, Raspberry Pi. The motion sensor, LEDs and a Raspberry Pi camera will be used in this project. Some pictures are included to give an idea of how the Image Recognition System looks like.
